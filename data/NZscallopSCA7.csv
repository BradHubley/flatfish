# Data for initial popn modelling of SCA7. No correction for dredge efficiency applied.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"# estimated numbers (millions), biomass (t greenweight), and average weight of recruits (70-89 mm) and commercial (90+) size scallops by region and year in SCA 7.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
# rec_no and com_no are the numbers of recruits and commercial size; Rgreen and Bgreen are the recruit and commercial size greenweight biomass. IR and I are the Rgreen and Bgreen converted to meat biomass using the recovery fraction (cond),,,,,,,,,,,,,
# w.bar and k.bar are the mean weight (greenweight / numbers) of recruits and commercial size scallops.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
# lbar and lk atr the mean length of the recruits and commercial size scallops,,,,,,,,,,,,,
# cond is the condition (recovery of meat from green weight during the fishing season). Used assumed average for years / regions with no recovery data.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
# C is the landed catch in t meatweight,,,,,,,,,,,,,
